# Sta215-Final
This is my final project where I collected data on metropolitan areas. I anaylsed the violent crime rate in each area.

**Instructions**
To utilize my script click on the file sta215-Rotmansky.R

**Data**
	The data I used for analyzes was metropolitan areas with populations over 100,00 and violent crime rates. Furthermore, I narrowed it down to the areas with a population over 500,000 and violent crime rates over 1000. I gathered the data by using the fbi crime rates and using a list of all the metropolitan areas with a population over 100,000 across the United States.

 **Operationalization**
 For the population I operationalized it into over populations 500,000 and populations under 500,000. Zero representing no, and one representing yes. I measured this concept this way to narrow it down a bit. As for the violent crime rate, I used the same method. I operationalized it into violent crime rates over 1,000 and violent crime rates under 1,000. I measure this concept this way also to narrow it down, to make it clear and concise about which areas had what.
